## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is a desire to recreate the [ddr-picker](https://github.com/dtammam/ddr-picker) project from scratch so that the larger rhythm-game community can easily use it for any of their needs. This has been a passion project since I first saw [evan clue's version](https://github.com/evanclue/ddr-picker) - it inspired me to make it my own by refactoring it in PowerShell and by adding tons of new features. Now, I'm off to do it again - by the end, it'll provide the best of the ddr-picker experience while having a seamless install experience for those not technically savvy.
